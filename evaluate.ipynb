They responded that I should just put the bride's name in the blank for the groom, and the groom's name in the blank for the bride, which would assure that it would be done correctly.  I very carefully did this, but you guessed it- I just received the picture (the most expensive version, $160, of course) and it had been personalized with the groom's name first.  I'm so disappointed, but no recourse left to me.<br />Also, they INSISTED on 0's in the date or would not accept it without those first two 0s:  04-09-2019, and then proceeded to include the first two 0's on the finished picture.  Looks weird and just WRONG, but I'm stuck with it, and will just give it to my granddaughter and husband with apologies, which is not what I should have to do.<br /> Beware, any prospective buyer--you might not get what you were expecting and hoping for...\n",
