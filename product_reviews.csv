"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck, Pour Over Coffee & Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, Auto Shut Off, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","This is a phenomenal kettle and it shows by the sheer amount of reviews and also the fact that it's mentioned on several other site reviews.PROs:- I love the way it's simple to use for both techies (like myself) and non-techies.- You can use the buttons on the heating base to choose basic temperature options such as DIY (this is for specific temperatures but you need the app), green tea (180 F), Oolong Tea (195 F), Coffee (205 F), and Black Tea/Boil (212 F). For those that want more, you can download the app, pair the kettle with your wifi/bluetooth, and you're good to go!-The best part is you can set it to keep warm and keep your temperature for up to 2hrs! This is good for those of us who like to multitask and don't want to start the boil all over again- The kettle also features a low water detection. So if you're getting carried away with using it from your phone and forget to add water, it won't burn itself out.Coffee Enthusiasts:Many times coffee recipes like Aeropress, Chemex, 360, Pour Over, French Press, etc will have specific temperatures to brew your coffee which does have a very important impact on level of extraction. This will sometimes conflict with the default setting of 205 F. Thus, this kettle will let you choose your exact temperature (via app only) and you'll be well on your way. You can press the DIY button or honestly just move the temperature slider in the app and you're golden.Overall this is a great product and worth the price even without the coupon. I do not understand why some of the popular kettles like Fellow's STAG or Corvo (I have two of their other products which I really enjoy. One of which is shown in the 2nd photo) cost so much.CONs:The only thing I dislike is the size of the kettle. Often times this is the case with gooseneck kettles but I can live with this. I just wished it was a bit bigger capacity.",5.0 out of 5 stars,a
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck, Pour Over Coffee & Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, Auto Shut Off, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","Purchase decision: I was looking for a temperature-controlled kettle for brewing tea and coffee.  There are much praise about the Fellow EKG in YouTube and elsewhere. But that is expensive for a simple kettle.  So I started looking at lower cost alternatives (note: the Fellow is still an option if I can't find a lower cost one I like).  I ended up with two alternatives:  the Cosori and the Govee.  One feature on the Fellow I don't care much about - the rate is restricted.  That makes it good for brewing coffee and bad for other general applications.  Both the Cosori and the Govee connects to a phone app for control.  The Cosori with bluetooth and the Govee with bluetooth, wifi, and Alexa.  Finally, I picked the Govee.Unpacking:  What a surprise!  For a $60 smart kettle, I don't really expect much quality.  Yet, the packaging is superb.  The paper instructions are clear and concise.  The quality of the kettle and the heating plate is very good.  I did fumble a little with the app, but not too bad.  The app is stable and the interface is pretty good and easy to follow.  Hooking up with Alexa is very simple with the instructions (with can't-go-wrong snapshot of interface).First use: Controlling the kettle with the buttons, the phone, or Alexa works as advertised - although I'm not sure how often I will use the fancy remote controls.  I attempted to measure the water temperature.  It appears that the temperature could be up to 5 degree F lower than the setpoint.  But the thermocouple used was not calibrated so I won't put much weight on the data.  May be I will try that again later with better equipment.First overall impression:  Very good value for the $$.  Will come back to comment on reliability, temperature accuracy etc. on later date.",5.0 out of 5 stars,a

"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck, Pour Over Coffee & Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, Auto Shut Off, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I‘ll be honest, I never use the app.  The buttons on the machine are enough.  I initially bought it because I thought using the app would be cool? But if I’m filling the kettle and it has presets on it, why would I take out my phone to adjust the temperature and press start? I suppose if the buttons ever jam or stop working the app will be useful, but other than that, it’s a beautiful little kettle and works great.",4.0 out of 5 stars,a
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck, Pour Over Coffee & Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, Auto Shut Off, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I previously owned a Fellow Stagg EKG+ kettle. I loved the ability to turn it on using an app since I work on the 2nd floor, and my kitchen is on the 1st floor. Overall, I really liked the Stagg kettle, but my wife hated it since it has a very low flow rate out of the spout. It is good for making pour-over coffee, but it's annoying for her when she makes tea. Our Stagg EKG+ finally died and I had to find a replacement. Stagg has a new updated kettle (EKG Pro), but it's more expensive and has the same restricted flow rate.I looked around and it's surprising how few WiFi enabled electric kettles exist. I finally found the Govee and I was suspicious since it is really affordable. I was used to overpaying for WiFi-enabled devices. I bought it and I couldn't be happier - it is perfect for me and my wife who drinks tea!Pros:1. Remote on/off via WiFi and the Govee app2. Ability to schedule in advance using the app3. Decent flow rate (much faster than the Stagg EKG kettle)4. The ""Hold temperature"" button works even if you take the kettle off and put it back on the base. Some kettles turn off the ""hold"" when you take the kettle off the base. For pour-over coffee drinkers, it's common pre-wet the filter and pre-wet the coffee grounds before doing the full pour of water. This means you'll take the kettle off the base at least 3 times when making coffee. It's nice to maintain the ""hold"" of the temperature throughout the process.5. The kettle heats water quickly6. The app is easy to use - both initial setup of the Kettle to WiFi and ongoing use is simple in the app7. The kettle is a great value - affordable with nice quality. It is definitely a much better value than the Stagg EKG kettle8. It can connect to Amazon Echo and Google devices (I don't use this, but it's possible)Cons:1. The app allows you to schedule heating of water in advance, but it is a one-time schedule. You can't (yet) set up a recurring schedule (e.g., heat up water every morning at 5:45am).2. The volume of the kettle is 0.8 L which is small. It's enough to make a single cup of coffee or tea, but just barely. You'll have to refill each time - slow if you are making more than one cup at a time.3. The looks are just ok to me - I think the Stagg EKG kettle looks better, but this is subjective and doesn't affect the taste of my coffee :-)In short, I recommend the Govee kettle and I'm very happy with the app and remote WiFi features!",5.0 out of 5 stars,a
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck, Pour Over Coffee & Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, Auto Shut Off, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","Compared to the price of others I say you get your money's worth. I like the app with all their other products to control everything. The temperature control is great to track, especially with the""keep warm"" settings. Pouring is satisfying and doesn't drip along the sides too.I like the design, it looks sleek and matches with a simple coffee bar too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,a

"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck, Pour Over Coffee & Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, Auto Shut Off, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I don't buy into the whole ""does it give you joy"" criteria for decluttering, but if I did, this  would be the last appliance  remaining save the Ninja Foodi (only because I have to have some way to cook food).I love how it looks, I love how quickly it heats water, and I love all the presets and ability to make custom presets.It's only glaring fault is the lack of a built in timer.If it weren't supposed to be ""smart"" I might forgive this oversight, but this is the only darned smart appliance I've allowed in my house and I can't believe no one thought to add timer presets or just a timer.I'd even be happy with just a few presets. I can count my 1 Mississippi 2 Mississippi's for my quick Gongfus, but once it gets to 30 seconds, give me that then some minute  increments. I can't think of when I am really going to use the app to start my pot (unless I need a custom temp), so have the pot a few months without even downloading the app until  today. I've usually got to fill the pot with water and get my tea ready anyway. I'm smart enough to not trust my ability to remember if I left enough tea in the pot, so I don't need it's smarts to remotely start heating my water. I need its smarts to time my tea because  too much of an airhead to remember to watch the clock oncey tea starts seeping.Still, I won't dock it a star for not being kind of  ""bright"" I find smart. I love it too much otherwise.",5.0 out of 5 stars,a

Boils pretty quickly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,a
