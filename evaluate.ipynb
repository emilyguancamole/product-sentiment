      "4071 This is a really cute bracelet but it faded in less than three weeks. Bought it on 8/22. It arrived the following week and started fading in about 10 days and is now completely faded. It’s hard to see the engraving as well. It’s very dainty. Don’t think I would recommend this one sadly.\n",

      "5032 Excellent\n",
      "5109 My 18 month old daughter is always wanting to touch and try my necklaces and earrings so we purchased her very first piece of jewelry.

      "5635 This item was not what I expected for the money, the bar was very small and the letters are so small on bar that makes it hard to read. Plus the extra chain that hangs from the hook is not safe for babies or toddler. Truly disappointed.\n",
      "5947 this is a very special made baby ID bracelet- baby bar is solid.  its strong,  Very polished good looking for a young baby.

      "7390 Not real gold but reasonable for kids/infant use.\n",
      "7962 I really like this bracelet! I ordered it for my two year old and it is small (meaning, not very wide) however, it is long enough to fit, with extra room as she grows! It is dainty, I like that! These reviews regarding the size are absurd,  what else do you expect for the price, it's a great deal for the price!\n",
      "7986 Broken and cheap. Not worth the buy. Can no longer lock\n",

      "8513 Very pretty bracelet. The name could have been better. You could hardly read it.\n",
      "8858 The bracelet is too small the font is even smaller. It broke in less than one day. This is not good for children at all. Definitely not good as a gift. Do not buy for children maybe for a doll.\n",

      "17447 This looks so cute on my little girl's wrist. She is 21 months but started to act like a \"fancy girl\" as soon as we put it on. She had a new sassiness to her attitude and did not want to take it off at the end of the day.\n",

      "21772 Disappointed very tiny barely able to read the name\n",
      "21917 Pros: comes quicker than expected and the price is right..it’s also cute at first for sure<br /><br />Cons: the “gold” color tarnished off in hours and turned my daughters wrist green…also the sizing is big and unless you want two inches of chain hanging off your baby’s wrist, you’d have to cut the excess off or go to a jeweler to fit it some other way<br /><br />Overall, spend the extra money on a real gold bracelet.\n",

      "22904 Although, this item is super cute to look at.. To actual purchase for living child is not advisable.  This item is sooooooo delicate that it got snag on all clothing and you will need to bring out your magnifying glass to read the engraving.  Really consider before purchasing.\n",

      "27796 Incredibly disappointed. What a waste of money. I ordered the rose gold bracelet with the name Leilani Ann and a hearr. The product description says ENGRAVED. What I received was a sad, illegible, (assuming laser) ETCHING of her name.<br />Even with improved technology, they really don't make things like they used to. Believe this and the other honest (negative) reviews. Find another place to make your meaningful item.\n",

      "28533 Not what I ordered. Says stamped, it's etched. very disappointed. Could have at least used a more feminine font, like script, since it's etched. It's cute, as long as you can't see her name\n",
      "28556 I dislike the fact about this product you have to pay for it to be returned and immediately turned a day or two after I received it\n",
      "28693 I am obsessed with this company...they are completely legit. I know their prices are really reasonably and that would make some question, but don’t! I ordered 3 bracelets for my nieces in rose gold and they are so cute and beautiful. I will definitely be back to order more when the time comes.\n",

I got this bracelet for my daughter because she loves when other people wear jewelry and loves looking at it/playing with it. When I tried her bracelet on her she got all excited, so as long as it makes my baby girl happy I'm happy!\n",

      "55946 Beautiful AT FIRST. My baby has worn her bracelet since Valentines day & it isn't March yet & it isn't rose gold anymore, it is a ugly copper color. Its seems very cheaply made. I wouldn't recommend. If you just want the baby to wear it for one or two events I think it would be fine.\n",

      "57514 This bracelet is so adorable. It looks super expensive in the rose gold and my granddaughter has worn it since birth! I loved it so much that I bought one for my great niece. I bought a third one for a size up for my granddaughter. Only one problem…it does lose its finish after a while. Like I said, my granddaughter wore hers for about 7 months before it started to fade around the clasp. For the money, it’s worth it! The actual bar hasn’t faded and my daughter said she would make that into a necklace later as a keepsake. If it hadn’t faded, it would have been a 5 star!\n",
      "57936 I like that the bracelet was available in several different sizes. The name plate is small enough for a little one and the chain seems sturdy enough that the baby won’t break it.\n",

As you can see in the photos it turned color very soon(5 days) and also her hand color changed. Since its baby product and gold, is scary to see change color and worried if it'll affect the kid skin.

      "68036 So this items really falls short of what I was hoping for. The gold coating rubbed off within the first day of my baby wearing it. So far no rash from it she's worn it about 3 times but I fear when more of the coating comes off it could end us causing a rash. I wanted to return this and the shipping was half the cost of the bracelet. They give you a shipping label then you go to return it, you'll find you'll have to pay for the return. I'm keeping it but we decided to just buy her a real gold bracelet this is total junk! Save your money.\n",

The full bar appears to be more of a square than a flat rectangle.  The personalization, though accurate, is barely readable.  I gave it to my Grandson as part of his Easter basket.  He has worn it a few days and the plating is already off of it.  Easter was less than a week ago.<br /><br />I am disappointed in it, but will keep it.\n",

I guess you get what you paid for.. the money I spent on this I would spend on take out, so it’s really no biggie.. if it fades or something I’ll just buy another one. All gold fades regardless how much you spend on it so I’m expecting it to fade which Is why I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a gold braclet... not the best... but not the worse.. once again , you can’t complain much about a $20 dollar bracelet.\n",

I came across this one and chose to go with this option as it was a great price and had great reviews. My son was only able to wear it for about a week as it turned silver/blackish. When I first opened it I loved it ,but it truly is poor quality and would not recommend it all as it is a waste of money and lasts so little.\n",

      "133176 First and Foremost: I bought this as a first birthday gift for my daughter.  Ordered 2 weeks prior to her day and it was anticipated to arrive 7-10 days before her day.  It arrived 6 days after her birthday, so as a gift, useless.  Amazon also did not allow me to contact seller/shipper or their own service line on this order.  They changed the delivery date three times and then stated that \"the package is not delivered late as the anticipated delivery date has not passed\"... well the date has not passed because you changed it, the original delivery date had passed by a week.<br />The bracelet itself is cute and looked great for photos and people love it!<br />The print looks like an old \"dot matrix\" printer and is difficult to read, but acceptable.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend.  If you cannot trust a ship date for a gift, then its not a good gift.\n",

      "133922 It’s cute and definitely the perfect size for my going to be 4 month old daughter on Christmas Day but the engraving wasn’t what I was expecting…. Can barely read it. Nearly impossible to see it. Really have to hold it at an angle to see what is on it… I got the front and back engraved. Definitely not worth the extra cost for the engraving. If you get it just pay for the bracelet and get someone else to engrave it for you.\n",

If you are going to buy this ask Dylan to engrave it deeper or bigger so that you can actually see what you wrote on the bracelet and also it’s better if you remove the chain and replace it with actual gold three days after my nephew got it the chain started to change colors\n",

They responded that I should just put the bride's name in the blank for the groom, and the groom's name in the blank for the bride, which would assure that it would be done correctly.  I very carefully did this, but you guessed it- I just received the picture (the most expensive version, $160, of course) and it had been personalized with the groom's name first.  I'm so disappointed, but no recourse left to me.<br />Also, they INSISTED on 0's in the date or would not accept it without those first two 0s:  04-09-2019, and then proceeded to include the first two 0's on the finished picture.
