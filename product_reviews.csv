"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I like this one a lot better than the fancier Stagg kettles I've used. I can get good flow control for pourovers, pour fast enough to not get annoyed when I make tea if I want, set very precise temperatures, and it has a keep warm. It looks nice and feels very well made, and the app control is quite simple to use. Really nice upgrade to my coffee corner.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I love this kettle! it works so good. features I love so far is that it gives me a notification on my phone when the kettles done. It can keep it warm for 30 mins. It also has presets. i watch the temperature in real time on my phone. you can turn it on with phone or smart speaker. You can set a schedule for when to turn it on.only cons so far is it's not very specific on how to set the Wi-Fi up. I don't know if I had to have it on and boiling water actively while setting the Wi-Fi up, but it was kind of stressful, i had it to hold temp. originally I turned it on and noticed it was dry boiling haha. keep in mind it only works with 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi, you might have to turn off your 5G. My Wi-Fi router supposed to send both signals, but I had to just manually type in the name and password to find it. I didn't even have to turn off my 5G first, but after that it's been pretty flawless",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","It does exactly what I needed and I had to spend half the amount I was expecting! The app is easy to use and the kettle looks sleek and performs well. It's just a tad bit noisy as it heats up, but not at all obnoxious.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I have been using this kettle for about a week.PROS:- Temperature control feature, especially for brewing coffee.- Looks nice.- Precise pour.- Easy to connect with the Govee app.CONS:- The max fill line is on the same side as the handle. This means that the kettle has to be rotated 180 degrees with the spout pointing towards you when filling. This is unnatural and inconvenient.- The capacity isn't sufficient to fill my tea pot. I wish the capacity was larger by about a cup.- The lid gets hot, so be careful when opening the pot after it has boiled. The lid handle itself is fine though.NEUTRAL:- The smart features are fine and easy to use, but I don't find them practical. It's not like the pot can fill itself with water or even tell you how much water it contains when you tell it to start heating. Maybe if you and the people you live with are diligent about refilling the pot after every time you use it, then you will find it more useful.I might put my large dumb kettle back on the counter for boiling large quantities of water, and use this kettle for coffee or other uses when I need to heat water to a specific temperature.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","Purchase decision: I was looking for a temperature-controlled kettle for brewing tea and coffee.  There are much praise about the Fellow EKG in YouTube and elsewhere. But that is expensive for a simple kettle.  So I started looking at lower cost alternatives (note: the Fellow is still an option if I can't find a lower cost one I like).  I ended up with two alternatives:  the Cosori and the Govee.  One feature on the Fellow I don't care much about - the rate is restricted.  That makes it good for brewing coffee and bad for other general applications.  Both the Cosori and the Govee connects to a phone app for control.  The Cosori with bluetooth and the Govee with bluetooth, wifi, and Alexa.  Finally, I picked the Govee.Unpacking:  What a surprise!  For a $60 smart kettle, I don't really expect much quality.  Yet, the packaging is superb.  The paper instructions are clear and concise.  The quality of the kettle and the heating plate is very good.  I did fumble a little with the app, but not too bad.  The app is stable and the interface is pretty good and easy to follow.  Hooking up with Alexa is very simple with the instructions (with can't-go-wrong snapshot of interface).First use: Controlling the kettle with the buttons, the phone, or Alexa works as advertised - although I'm not sure how often I will use the fancy remote controls.  I attempted to measure the water temperature.  It appears that the temperature could be up to 5 degree F lower than the setpoint.  But the thermocouple used was not calibrated so I won't put much weight on the data.  May be I will try that again later with better equipment.First overall impression:  Very good value for the $$.  Will come back to comment on reliability, temperature accuracy etc. on later date.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I was in need of a new tea kettle when my old one died. I got a $25 off coupon for this one and I jumped on it. I absolutely love the app that controls the kettle. When I wake up, I decide what tea I want to drink and then use the app to turn it on to the right temperature. I can do the same thing in the middle of the work day. There are pre-set temperatures but you can add your own custom settings as well. So far the kettle works well and seems accurate. I’m getting used to having to make sure that I fill the kettle every night before bed so it’s ready to go in the morning. Over time, that might lead to a need for more frequent cleanings but we will see. There’s just one downside to this kettle and that’s the cover. It feels flimsy and is very hard to remove from the kettle, and I have taken to wearing oven mitts because when you finally free it up it usually spatters hot water drops around. The company should definitely work on this as it is a serious flaw. I love the app so much that I couldn’t deduct a star though!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","I previously owned a Fellow Stagg EKG+ kettle. I loved the ability to turn it on using an app since I work on the 2nd floor, and my kitchen is on the 1st floor. Overall, I really liked the Stagg kettle, but my wife hated it since it has a very low flow rate out of the spout. It is good for making pour-over coffee, but it's annoying for her when she makes tea. Our Stagg EKG+ finally died and I had to find a replacement. Stagg has a new updated kettle (EKG Pro), but it's more expensive and has the same restricted flow rate.I looked around and it's surprising how few WiFi enabled electric kettles exist. I finally found the Govee and I was suspicious since it is really affordable. I was used to overpaying for WiFi-enabled devices. I bought it and I couldn't be happier - it is perfect for me and my wife who drinks tea!Pros:1. Remote on/off via WiFi and the Govee app2. Ability to schedule in advance using the app3. Decent flow rate (much faster than the Stagg EKG kettle)4. The ""Hold temperature"" button works even if you take the kettle off and put it back on the base. Some kettles turn off the ""hold"" when you take the kettle off the base. For pour-over coffee drinkers, it's common pre-wet the filter and pre-wet the coffee grounds before doing the full pour of water. This means you'll take the kettle off the base at least 3 times when making coffee. It's nice to maintain the ""hold"" of the temperature throughout the process.5. The kettle heats water quickly6. The app is easy to use - both initial setup of the Kettle to WiFi and ongoing use is simple in the app7. The kettle is a great value - affordable with nice quality. It is definitely a much better value than the Stagg EKG kettle8. It can connect to Amazon Echo and Google devices (I don't use this, but it's possible)Cons:1. The app allows you to schedule heating of water in advance, but it is a one-time schedule. You can't (yet) set up a recurring schedule (e.g., heat up water every morning at 5:45am).2. The volume of the kettle is 0.8 L which is small. It's enough to make a single cup of coffee or tea, but just barely. You'll have to refill each time - slow if you are making more than one cup at a time.3. The looks are just ok to me - I think the Stagg EKG kettle looks better, but this is subjective and doesn't affect the taste of my coffee :-)In short, I recommend the Govee kettle and I'm very happy with the app and remote WiFi features!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","My daughter bought one and had d over for coffee which was phenomenal. We talked about the features like turning it on from your phone before you get out of bed or jump in the shower! Has select temps for perfect brews of coffee and teas. Heats up super fast and the water pours with ease thanks to the gooseneck design. Oh yeah, I went home and ordered it overnight and use it everyday. Smart and stylish",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Govee Smart Electric Kettle, WiFi Variable Temperature Gooseneck Pour Over Kettle and Tea Kettle, Alexa Control, 1200W Quick Heating, 100% Stainless Steel, 0.8L, Matte Black","Yes, you could spend a lot less on a kettle. But the second you step into ""smart"" territory that wouldn't be true anymore.I can't think of a feature that this kettle doesn't have, and yet it isn't so much more expensive that I feel ridiculous not getting a basic kettle.All of which is to say that I think this hits the perfect sweet spot. Are you paying more? Yes. Is it worth it? If you enjoy ""smart"" tech, yes.And if you aren't into ""smart"" tech? Well, what are you looking at this thing for? Go spend $15 on a regular kettle and enjoy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
